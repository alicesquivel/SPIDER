SPIDER: Sustainable Policy-based Intelligence Driven Edge Routing
for energy-aware and low-latency Visual Data Applications  
=================
In this project, we develop a 
Proposed algorithm is evaluted with event-driven (ns-3) simulations, and we establish the practicality of our approach in a real incident-supporting hierarchical cloud deployment to demonstrate ... under severe node failures and high mobility challenges of disaster response scenarios.

How does SPIDER work?
==================
SPIDER works with Python 2.7.

SPIDER first obtains a geographical knowledge of the physical obstacles (e.g., extracts this information from the satellite imagery available at the edge cloud using deep learning) and then propagates it from the gateway as shown in the figure below:

![Figure](/img/scenarios.png)

**Figure **: *First scenario (a), we evaluate our approach under severe failures, and in the second scenario (b), we evaluate our approach under high mobility. *

Facial Recognition Application: SPIDER first extracts geographical knowledge of physical obstacles from the pre-uploaded at the edge cloud satellite imagery and then offloading visual data processing using UDP to the gateway during disaster-incident response activities within a lost infrastructure region to provide sustainable performance and energy-efficient IoT application.

What is inside?
================
The source code for the Elsevier FGCS submission (SI on Information and Resource Management Systems for Internet of Things: Energy Management, Communication Protocols and Future Applications).

NS-3 simulation is used to evalute the application level throughput gained by those greedy forwarding protocols as well as by commonly used AODV and HWMP protocols under severe node failures and high mobility challenges of disaster response scenarios
